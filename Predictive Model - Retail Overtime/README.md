Training various regression models to predict overtime per worker required to reach target productivity.

Gaps in predicted production versus actual production can cause major issues in clothing supply and​ demand. 
The objective of this project is to predict the amount of overtime required per worker to reach target productivity for a retail clothing manufacturer. Various models were explored including Polynomial Regression, Ridge Cross Validation Regression, and Lasso Cross Validation Regression. 

The data (obtained from Kaggle) is based on one organization’s clothing production, which is heavily dependent on human labor.  
Each row represents data based on daily metrics. There are twenty-six columns in the original data file. They are team, targeted productivity, allocated time for a task (svm), number of unfinished items for products (wip), overtime, incentive, idle time, idle men, number of style change, number of workers, month, quarter 1, quarter 2, quarter 3, quarter 4, quarter 5, finishing department, sewing department, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday.
