The scenario for this repository folder is focused on the mindset of a data scientist working for an airline. The objective of the project is to explore effective data storytelling and visualization through different mediums to various audiences. The business problem is that the media is spreading false information about flight safety and consumers are scared to fly. As the data scientist, I'm approaching data story-telling in five different ways:
1. Internal team dashboard to observe exploratory data analysis at a glance that's easy to interpret.
2. Internal executive summary to key stakeholders for awareness and buy-in for approaching the media.
3. External informal blog post to challenge the media and influence consumers of the facts.
4. External infographic for a glance of the facts when passing by it in an airport or other location.
5. External video clip/commercial to socialize to consumers.
