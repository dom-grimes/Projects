This model identifies potential bank client churn proactively to anticipate a clientâ€™s departure. 
This allows teammates to act and save the client relationship prior to a loss, which minimizes attrition and maximizes profits.

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle which captures attrition behavior per bank client up to a certain point in time. 
There are thirteen features and ten-thousand rows available for analysis. 
Each row represents an individual bank client.
The features consist of:
CustomerID,
Surname,
CreditScore,
Geography,
Gender,
Age,
Tenure,
Balance,
NumberofProducts,
HasCrCard,
IsActiveMember,
EstimatedSalary,
