In our fast-paced world clients are looking for on-demand service. To support the balance of timely service and expense, chatbots are utilized to optimize data enablement. Chatbots are computer programs that simulate human conversation through text or phone interactions. This tool allows end users to find information more independently and efficiently while reducing expense for the organization. 

I am using a JSON file from Data Flair that contains categories as well as pre-defined patterns and responses. 
There are fourteen categories labeled as “tag”. These tags are focused on general greetings, closings, and health-related topics.
The tags are greeting, goodbye, thanks, noanswer, options, adverse_drug, blood_pressure, blood_pressure_search, search_blood_pressure_by_patient_id, pharmacy_search, search_pharmacy_by_name, hospital_search, search_hospital_by_params, search_hospital_by_type.
